# Documentation Updated - Page Structure Simplified

**Date:** December 22, 2025  
**Change:** Merged Expertise into About page  
**Status:** ✅ All documentation updated

---

## Summary

Per your request, I've merged the Expertise page into the About page, creating a single comprehensive page instead of two separate ones.

## What Changed

### Page Count
**Before:** 5 pages (Homepage, Services, Approach, About, Expertise, Contact)  
**After:** 4 pages (Homepage, Services, Approach, **About**, Contact)

### Progress Update
**Before:** 2 of 5 pages complete (40%)  
**After:** 2 of 4 pages complete (50%)

---

## About Page Structure (New)

The combined About page will have:

1. **Profile/Introduction** - Who we are (new section)
2. **Certifications & Credentials** - Detailed breakdown
3. **Technical Expertise** - 4 categories  
4. **Industry Experience** - Industries + regions

This creates a more comprehensive and impactful "About" destination.

## Documentation Files Updated

All 5 core documentation files have been updated:

✅ **NEXT-STEPS.md**
- Renamed Phase 4 to "About Page"
- Updated structure and content plan
- Adjusted time estimate to 3-4 hours
- Updated all page counts (5→4) and percentages (40%→50%)

✅ **CURRENT-STATE.md**
- Updated page statistics
- Updated remaining pages list

✅ **README.md**
- Updated project statistics
- Updated "Next Up" section

✅ **SESSION-SUMMARY.md**
- Added note about page structure update

✅ **DOCUMENTATION-UPDATES.md**
- Complete record of this change

## Benefits

1. **Simpler navigation** - 4 main pages instead of 5
2. **More impactful** - Comprehensive About page tells full story
3. **Better UX** - Related content grouped logically
4. **No timeline impact** - Still 11-15 hours to launch

---

## Next Steps

**No immediate action required.** When building the About page:
- Use existing Expertise content from `/plan/CONTENT-STRATEGY.md`
- Add Profile section at the beginning
- Create `/content/about.json` (not expertise.json)
- Estimated time: 3-4 hours

---

## Status

✅ **Documentation fully updated and consistent**  
✅ **Ready for continuation in new session**  
✅ **All references to 5 pages changed to 4 pages**  
✅ **Better site structure established**

---

**The change is complete and improves the project.** 🎯
