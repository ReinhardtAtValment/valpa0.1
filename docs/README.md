## 📖 Documentation Philosophy

### Why This Documentation Exists

**Problem:** AI agents don't have memory between sessions
**Solution:** Comprehensive external memory system

**This documentation system:**
- Captures all context
- Documents all decisions
- Provides clear instructions
- Enables seamless handoffs
- Maintains consistency

**Rule:** If it's not documented, it didn't happen.

### Documentation Maintenance

**After EVERY significant change:**
1. Create completion doc in `/plan`
2. Update `CURRENT-STATE.md`
3. Update `HANDOFF-INSTRUCTIONS.md` date
4. Update relevant docs if patterns change

**Weekly/Session:**
- Review and update `NEXT-STEPS.md`
- Add new patterns to `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`
- Update `PROJECT-CONTEXT.md` if needed

---

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Core Values
- **Professional** - No marketing fluff, credible
- **Specific** - Concrete examples, not generic
- **Consistent** - Same patterns everywhere
- **Modern** - Contemporary design aesthetic
- **Accessible** - Works for everyone

### Technical Principles
- **DRY** - Don't Repeat Yourself
- **Separation of Concerns** - Content/Presentation/Logic
- **TypeScript Safety** - Catch errors early
- **Reusability First** - Components over duplication
- **Documentation Required** - Everything documented

→ Look at existing pages for examples
→ Follow `HANDOFF-INSTRUCTIONS.md` workflow

### "What's been done?"
→ Read `CURRENT-STATE.md`
→ Check `/plan` directory for logs

### "What should I build next?"
→ Read `NEXT-STEPS.md`
→ Start with Priority 1 items

### "How does the business work?"
→ Read `PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`
→ Check `/mnt/project/` reference docs

### "What are the design rules?"

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

### Always Remember

1. **Read Documentation First**
   Don't start building until you've read the docs

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**
   Copy what works, don't reinvent

3. **Use Reusable Components**
   Check before creating new components

4. **Alternate Backgrounds**
   White → Gray → White → Gray (never same adjacent)

5. **Document Everything**
   If you built it, document it

6. **Test As You Go**
   Don't wait until the end

7. **Maintain Standards**
   Consistency is more important than innovation

### Never Do These

❌ Hardcode content in components
❌ Create duplicate components
❌ Ignore design system
❌ Skip documentation
❌ Put same backgrounds adjacent
❌ Forget responsive design
❌ Skip accessibility
