## 1. Hero section

### 1.1 Hero headline

**Current**

> Build lasting capabilities in process, data and governance.

**Suggested**

> **Build lasting capabilities in process & data intelligence, enterprise architecture, and governed innovation.**

Keeps the original rhythm but makes the three pillars explicit.

### 1.2 Subheadline (under hero)

**Current** ([Valment][1])

> Make SAP modernization succeed. Strengthen AI transformation and AI agent implementation—with proper guardrails, ownership, and auditability. Use process intelligence and value-driven prioritization to focus on the right work and implement it with control.

**Suggested**

> Make SAP modernization succeed. Strengthen AI transformation and AI agent implementation—with proper guardrails, ownership, and auditability. Use process and data intelligence, value-driven portfolios, and light governance to focus on the right innovation bets and implement them with control.

Small tweaks:

* “process and data intelligence” → aligns to hero.
* “right innovation bets” → brings innovation in as **outcome**, not a buzzword.

### 1.3 Three pillars (See / Decide / Deliver)

**See what is real – subline**

Current:

> Process analytics and mining to expose bottlenecks, variants, delays, and complexity drivers. ([Valment][1])

Suggested (small tweak):

> Process and data intelligence to expose bottlenecks, variants, delays, and complexity drivers.

---

**Decide what matters – subline**

Current:

> Initiative portfolio ranked by value, effort, risk, and dependencies—decision-ready for leadership. ([Valment][1])

Suggested:

> Improvement and innovation portfolio ranked by value, effort, risk, and dependencies—decision-ready for leadership.

---

**Deliver with control – subline**

Current:

> Governance, cadence, and coaching so improvements land safely and create measurable value. ([Valment][1])

Suggested:

> Governance, cadence, and coaching so improvements and innovation land safely and create measurable value.

This keeps your “governed innovation” idea consistent without overdoing it.

---

## 2. “A practical way to build lasting capabilities” (Approach intro)

**Current** ([Valment][2])

> Valment turns process and data signals into a prioritized improvement portfolio—and puts governance in place so value is delivered repeatedly, not once.

**Suggested**

> Valment turns process and data signals into a value-driven innovation portfolio—and puts governance in place so value is delivered repeatedly, not once.

This is the main place I’d explicitly say “innovation portfolio.”

---

## 3. Steps 01–03 (Approach section)

### 3.1 Step 01 – Title + description

**Title (keep)**

> **Step 01 – Discovery & Baseline**

**Description – light touch**

Current:

> See what's really happening. Establish a fact-based baseline across key processes, quantify bottlenecks and variants, and define measurable outcomes. ([Valment][2])

Suggested:

> See what's really happening. Establish a fact-based baseline across key processes, quantify bottlenecks and variants, and define measurable outcomes and innovation levers.

---

### 3.2 Step 02 – New name and copy

**Current title**

> Step 02 – Value-Based Portfolio

**Suggested title**

> **Step 02 – Value-Driven Innovation Portfolio**

This is fine – it’s not too much as long as Step 02 is the **only** place with that exact phrase.

**Current description** ([Valment][2])

> Turn insights into an executable plan. Convert findings into initiatives with owners, effort/value estimates, and dependencies—ready for leadership decisions.

**Suggested description**

> Turn insights into an executable innovation portfolio. Convert findings into initiatives and experiments with clear owners, value/effort estimates, and dependencies—ready for leadership decisions.

---

### 3.3 Step 03 – Governance & Enablement

**Title (keep)**

> **Step 03 – Governance & Enablement**

**Description – slight tweak**

Current:

> Make improvement sustainable. Set up a lightweight cadence to track outcomes, remove blockers, and transfer capability into the organization. ([Valment][2])

Suggested:

> Make improvement and innovation sustainable. Set up a lightweight cadence to track outcomes, remove blockers, and transfer capability into the organization.

---

## 4. “Where we apply the approach” (Service area intros)

### 4.1 Section intro

**Current** ([Valment][2])

> Choose the service area where you need support. We bring the same disciplined approach to each domain.

**Suggested**

> Choose the service area where you need support. We bring the same disciplined approach to process and data intelligence, enterprise architecture, and governed innovation across each domain.

Short, but clearly echoes the hero.

---

### 4.2 Service tiles

#### a) Process Analytics & Continuous Improvement

**Current tagline**

> Make process behavior visible. Build a repeatable improvement loop. ([Valment][2])

**Suggested tagline**

> Make process behavior visible. Build a repeatable improvement and innovation loop.

**Optional extra sentence after the first paragraph**

Current first paragraph:

> Provide architecture governance that strengthens delivery rather than slowing it down. Clear principles, practical guidance, and integration into your transformation approach. ([Valment][2])

Append:

> Make EA the backbone for how innovation is evaluated, prioritized, and executed.

---

#### d) AI Governance & AI Agent Governance Foundations

Already very “governed innovation” by nature; just one subtle tweak.

**Current tagline**

> Enable AI adoption with accountability and control. ([Valment][2])

**Suggested tagline**

> Enable AI-driven innovation with accountability and control.

**Key outcomes – optional small change**

Current bullet:

> * Guardrails for increasing AI autonomy ([Valment][2])

Suggested:

> * Guardrails for increasing AI autonomy and agent-driven innovation

---

## 5. “Ways to work together”

### 5.1 Section intro

**Current** ([Valment][2])

> Choose the engagement format that matches your urgency and capacity. Each format applies across all service areas and is designed to create measurable progress and strengthen internal capability.

**Suggested**

---

## 6. “Why Valment” + Certifications

### 6.1 Section intro

**Current** ([Valment][2])

> A capability-first mindset that builds what you need inside your organization rather than creating external dependency.

**Suggested**

> A capability-first mindset that builds what you need inside your organization—so process and data intelligence, enterprise architecture, and innovation are governed and sustainable, not consultant-dependent.

---

### 6.2 Embedded, accountable leadership

Optional tweak to first sentence:

Current:

> We work inside your teams, not as external observers. Outcomes, not hours. ([Valment][2])

Suggested:

> We work inside your teams, not as external observers. Outcomes and learning, not hours.

(Subtle push toward capability-building and innovation, without saying the word again.)

---

### 6.3 Modern tool fluency

Optional tweak to last sentence:

Current:

> Deep experience with SAP, process mining, data platforms, and AI governance tools that enterprises actually use. ([Valment][2])

Suggested:

> Deep experience with SAP, process mining, data platforms, and AI governance tools that enterprises actually use to drive innovation safely.

---

## 7. Contact page

Keep the title, but slightly adjust the core description.

**Tagline line (under `## Discovery & Baseline`):**

```md

```

(You can leave that unchanged.)

**Description sentence:**

Current:

Our mission is simple: make business value and innovation outcomes visible, trackable, and sustainable. Whether you're optimizing SAP processes, modernizing your architecture, or governing AI and agent adoption, we apply the same disciplined methodology to ensure execution and results.
```

And tweak the engagement paragraph slightly:

```md

```

---

### 3.3 Core Capabilities – intro
