Good instinct – “enterprise architecture” is much clearer and positions you exactly where you want to be.

Let’s standardize on it.

I’ll give you **updated text blocks** you can paste in to replace what we already prepared. Anywhere “architecture” was used as a *discipline* I’ll now use **enterprise architecture**. Where it’s about “system architectures” (e.g. “side-by-side architectures”), I’ll leave it as is.

## 1. Hero area (Home)

**Headline**

```text
Build lasting capabilities in enterprise architecture and process intelligence for governed innovation.
```

**Subheadline**

```text
Make SAP modernization and AI transformation succeed—with proper guardrails, ownership, and auditability. For SAP-centric organizations, we use enterprise architecture and process intelligence, value-driven portfolios, and lean governance to focus on the right innovation bets and implement them with control.
```

Replace your current hero + subheadline with these.

---

## 2. Services page – places to update “architecture” → “enterprise architecture”

### 2.1 Services intro

Replace the top intro with:

```md
We help SAP-centric organizations build lasting capabilities in enterprise architecture and process intelligence for governed innovation. Our work combines process and data intelligence, enterprise architecture, and lean governance to turn real execution data into a value-driven innovation portfolio.

The same approach applies in each service area:
**Discovery & Baseline → Value-Driven Innovation Portfolio → Governance & Enablement**.
```

### 2.2 SAP Modernization & Clean-Core Discovery (small tweak)

In the “Purpose” under that service, use:

```md
Support SAP transformations by reducing complexity and enabling future innovation on a clean, governed core, informed by process and data intelligence and enterprise architecture insight.
```

(Everything else in the Services draft already uses “enterprise architecture” where it matters, so you’re aligned.)

---

## 3. Approach page – updated intros and a few lines

### 3.1 Approach intro

**Title**

```md
# Approach

## One approach across enterprise architecture, process intelligence, data, and AI
```

**Intro paragraph**

```md
Whether we work on process analytics, SAP modernization, enterprise architecture, or AI governance, we use the same core pattern to build lasting capabilities in enterprise architecture and process intelligence for governed innovation.
```

Keep the line with:

```md
**Discovery & Baseline → Value-Driven Innovation Portfolio → Governance & Enablement**
```

as is.

### 3.2 Step 02 – Value-Driven Innovation Portfolio

In the description we had:

> This is where we link process and data intelligence to enterprise architecture and delivery capacity.

That already matches your wording – no change needed.

In the “You get” bullets, update this one:

```md
- A realistic sequence that respects process, data, and enterprise architecture constraints
```

### 3.3 Step 03 – Governance & Enablement

Update these two lines:

**What we do – last bullet**

```md
- Surface and remove blockers that span process, data, and enterprise architecture
```

**You get – third bullet**

```md
- Stronger internal capability in process & data intelligence and enterprise architecture
```

Everything else on the Approach page already aligns.

---

## 4. About page – updated top sections

### 4.1 Top tagline

Replace:

> Bridging architecture, process intelligence, data, and AI for governed innovation

with:

```md
Bridging enterprise architecture, process intelligence, data, and AI for governed innovation
```

### 4.2 First paragraph (“About Valment” intro)

Replace the first paragraph with:

```md
Valment helps SAP-centric organizations build lasting capabilities in enterprise architecture and process intelligence for governed innovation. The work sits at the intersection of process & data intelligence, enterprise architecture, and AI/agent governance – with a clear focus on measurable business value.
```

(The second paragraph starting “Rather than running one-off projects…” can stay as is.)

### 4.3 “How we work” – architecture sentence

In that section, adjust this line:

**Before**

> Architecture is used to link business capabilities, processes, applications, and data…

**After**

```md
Enterprise architecture is used to link business capabilities, processes, applications, and data – ensuring innovation does not break the fundamentals.
```

Everything else in the About draft already says “enterprise architecture” where appropriate (e.g. “Enterprise Architecture & Transformation Governance”).

---

If you copy these blocks in, you’ll be consistently positioned as:

> *“enterprise architecture + process intelligence for governed innovation”*

across **Home, Services, Approach, and About** without having to redo all the work again.
