I'm continuing the Valment website project. We've completed Phase 1 (Design System) and are ready to start Phase 2 (Home Page).

**PROJECT:**
- Location: `C:\Users\rmueh\OneDrive\Documents\atValment\www\valpa0.1`

- Brand: "Valment" (public) / "Valment Partners Inc." (legal)
- All planning: `/plan` directory

**COMPLETED:**
✅ Phase 0: Foundation (design tokens, Next.js setup)
✅ Phase 1: Design System
  - Layout: Header, Footer
  - Components: Button, Section, Heading, FeatureCard, Card, Badge, CertificationBadge
  - Icons: lucide-react organized by category
  - Showcases: `/app/design-system`, `/app/components-showcase`, `/app/icons-badges`

**CURRENT STEP:**
Phase 2, Step 2.1: Hero Section

**WHAT TO BUILD:**
Hero section for home page with:
- Headline about process discovery & improvement portfolio
- Subheadline about governance and business value
- CTA button
- Use existing Section, Heading, Button components
- Follow brand guidelines in `/plan/BRAND-GUIDELINES.md`

**APPROACH:**
- Use shadcn/ui as base, customize as needed
- Build incrementally with checkpoints
- Document in `/plan/phase-2-home-page/step-2.1-hero.md`
- Reference `/plan/MASTER-PLAN.md` for overall roadmap

**BUSINESS CONTEXT:**
See attached documents for business profile and GTM strategy. Key message: "We help organizations discover, prioritize, and deliver process improvements – including automation and agentic AI – using process & data intelligence."

Please help me start Step 2.1: Hero Section. Review `/plan/phase-2-home-page/step-2.1-hero.md`, create the hero component, and integrate it into `app/page.tsx`. Follow our methodical approach with documentation updates.
